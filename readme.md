# JS Fractal Visualizer

This is a simple browser fractal exploration tool with limited performance and precision due to that fact.

**In the likely event that you do not know how to use this**
# <u>How To Run:</u>
* Download it onto any computer with a browser installed, you can do this by clicking the green `Code` button at the top right of the file viewer
* Unpack the zip
* Open `index.html`, your computer should be smart enough to do this with a browser, but if not, you can Right Click > Open With > *Browser* (on windows)
# <u>How To Use:</u>
* The fractal should automatically render a full view when you open the page from left to right. In addition there should be a smaller black box (the nav pane) and a larger box with sliders (control pane)
* The **nav pane** won't show a preview until the first render is complete and you click and drag it for the first time, the nav pane allows you to select a specific area of the fractal to render by clicking and dragging to pan, and scrolling to zoom in and out. The full view of the fractal will not update until told to.
* The **Control Pane** has several settings that control how the fractal is rendered. There is
	- Resolution controls the resolution of the final render (specifically the height). It defaults to 1400 x 800
	- Iterations/Frame controls the number of points that the visualizer tries to render each frame. Set it too low and the render will barely crawl along. Set it too high and your fps will drop and it won't render any faster. 800-1000 is pretty decent for my laptop.
	- Hue Shift allows you to control the color of the render, if you are familiar with HSL color format, the hue shift setting ranges from 0 to 360 degrees. By default points with the least number of iterations are colored red (0 degrees) but this allows you to change that.
	- Max Iterations controls how many times one point will be iterated before the program gives up. Setting it higher will give you a more exact shape of the fractal, but it will also reduce the overall contrast/variety of colors and will make the render take longer
	- Fractal allows you to change the fractal you're looking at
	- Orbit Traps enables an alternate rendering mode that instead renders the points based on how close they approached the origin (0, 0)
* **To apply any of your changes**, simply click the big `Render` button.

# <u>Navigating</u>:
There are several methods to navigate a fractal, you can click & drag on the nav window or the fractal itself to move around. Scrolling your mousewheel over either will zoom you in and out. If you're feeling precise you can also input exact X and Y coordinates in the respective X and Y boxes ( these coordinates correspond to the upper left of the view ). If you move around however you might notice that there are black edges to the fractal, or it gets pixilated very fast. Once you've panned the view over to an area of the fractal you want to get a better look at, press the `Render` button again to render that section in more detail. Due to floating point limitations however, once you hit a zoom scale of ~ 1e-15 you'll notice everything looks very blocky. It's impossible to get any meaningful detail beyond this point.

# <u>The Fractals:</u>
There are 7 currently implemented fractals:
* The Burning Ship
	* Represented by the function <img style="background-color: white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c163d06790d201f33305e5eae47b523a6c8b1e33">
* Broken Burning Ship
	* A version of the burning ship where the initial x and y values are swapped before iteration
* The Mandelbrot Set
	* Framous fractal represented by the function <img style="background-color: white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/191627a3eebdd6608c9b226786defc468b747502">
* Chirinov Map / Standard Map
	* Represented by the function <img style="background-color: white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6aaa7238221f3348dbbe5699896a81e113713040">, <img style="background-color: white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c3e9303a68971b9dbe32c071ed06415a9a52636">
* HÃ©non Map
	* Represented by the function <img style="background-color: white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87672565712868250e7d2b410307bb1b047f31a7">
* Tricorn / Mandelbar
	* Similar to the mandelbrot set, represented by <img style="background-color: white; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/adee2ebd905355474d40cca3df638690e8fa0893">
* Mandelbox
	* Similar to the mandelbrot, however, it can be defined in any dimension with ease. It is represented by an iterative set of steps that are dependent on x and y's value as they iterate. It can also be manipulated by a constant (Defaults to 2 for now).
### Quick Tips:
* When zooming in on a complicated fractal, it can help to increase the max iterations. While an area of the fractal may look solid, increasing this value will often expose more patterns to explore:
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
	<img style="width: 350px; height: 200px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/HVcrglI.png">
	<img style="width: 350px; height: 200px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/rZEdmDc.png">
	<img style="width: 350px; height: 200px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/6kssUsE.png">
</div>

_The same region rendered with 100, 200, and 300 max iterations respectively_

* Be Sure to adjust Iterations/Frame, it make make navigating much smoother on faster devices
	- Turning down the resolution can also help
* Using the hue shift slider can make some areas significantly easier on the eyes, greens and yellows can be particularly annoying to make sense of
* Black pixels take longer to render, so if you're looking to move around quickly, pan the view so that it is mostly colored pixels

## Known Issues
* Higher `Max Iteration` values cause certain details to get blended together due to how a points hue is calculated
	- Possible implementation of color curves to allow for user customization of the rendering
* Zooming in extremely far can cause loss of details (This is more of a JS floating point thing and there isn't much I can do about it)
